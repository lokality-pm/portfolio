## Overview

The Todo Calendar App is a comprehensive task management application that combines traditional todo list functionality with advanced calendar scheduling features. Built with Streamlit and Python, this project demonstrates full-stack product development from concept to deployment.

The primary purpose of this app is to:

- **Schedule and organize tasks** with due date functionality and calendar visualization
- **Provide multiple view modes** including list view, calendar view, and analytics dashboard  
- **Enable smart filtering** with options like "Today", "This Week", "Overdue", and custom date ranges
- **Deliver actionable insights** through completion statistics and productivity analytics
- **Maintain data persistence** using JSON file storage for reliable task management

## Key Features & Product Impact

### ðŸ“… **Calendar Integration**
- Visual month calendar with color-coded task indicators
- Due date scheduling with intuitive date picker widgets
- Today highlighting and overdue task warnings
- Task count indicators for quick workload assessment

### ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Organization**
- Automatic categorization: Overdue â†’ Due Today â†’ Upcoming â†’ No Due Date â†’ Completed
- Advanced filtering by date ranges and task status
- Expandable completed tasks section to reduce interface clutter
- Inline due date editing for quick task rescheduling

### ðŸ“Š **Analytics Dashboard**
- Completion rate tracking with visual progress indicators
- Task distribution charts showing status breakdown
- Due date analytics with time-based categorization
- Performance metrics for productivity insights

## Technical Architecture

**Framework/Stack**: Python + Streamlit + Pandas + JSON

**Key Technical Decisions**:
- **Streamlit** for rapid prototyping and interactive web interface
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and chart generation  
- **JSON** for lightweight, human-readable data persistence
- **Python datetime** for robust date/time handling
- **Modular design** with separate functions for data operations

**Development Process**:
- Iterative development using Claude Code for AI-assisted programming
- User-centered design principles for intuitive interface
- Responsive layout supporting mobile and desktop viewing

## Product Development Journey

### Initial Requirements
Starting with a simple todo list application, the product evolved through user-centered design thinking:

1. **Basic todo functionality** - Add, complete, delete tasks
2. **Enhanced with scheduling** - Due dates and calendar integration  
3. **Advanced analytics** - Productivity insights and completion tracking
4. **Smart filtering** - Multiple views and date-based organization

### Key Product Decisions

**Why Calendar Integration?**
Research shows that visual scheduling significantly improves task completion rates. The calendar view provides immediate context about workload distribution and helps users identify potential bottlenecks.

**Why Multiple View Modes?**
Different users have different workflow preferences. The three-view approach (List, Calendar, Analytics) caters to:
- **List View**: Traditional task management users
- **Calendar View**: Visual planners and schedule-oriented users  
- **Analytics**: Data-driven users seeking productivity insights

**Why Local JSON Storage?**
For an MVP and demonstration purposes, JSON provides simplicity and transparency. Users can easily backup/transfer their data, and the approach demonstrates data modeling without external dependencies.

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- **Cloud deployment** with Heroku/Railway for public access
- **Data export** functionality (CSV, iCal integration)
- **Recurring tasks** for habit tracking and regular commitments
- **Task categorization** with tags and priority levels

### Phase 3 Advanced Features  
- **Team collaboration** with shared task lists
- **Integration APIs** with Google Calendar, Outlook
- **Mobile app** using React Native or Flutter
- **AI-powered** task prioritization and scheduling suggestions

## Lessons Learned

### Product Management Insights
- **Iterative development** allowed for rapid feature validation and user feedback integration
- **Data-driven design** decisions improved user experience (e.g., color coding for overdue tasks)
- **Modular architecture** enabled quick feature additions without breaking existing functionality

### Technical Learning
- **Streamlit's strengths** for rapid MVP development and interactive dashboards
- **State management** challenges in web applications and solutions using session state
- **Date/time handling** complexities and the importance of timezone considerations

This project demonstrates the full product lifecycle from ideation through development to user testing, showcasing both technical implementation skills and product management thinking.
